# What to include in the data folder of an R project?
- `data/` should contain data files used in the analysis. `RDS` files should be preferred over `CSV` or `Excel` files. 
- If the data is too large to be included in the repository, it should be downloaded from elsewhere, such as a public source or a private source with permission.
- If the data is sensitive, it should not be included in the repository. Instead, it should be stored securely and accessed using a secure connection.
- The `.gitignore` file can be used to avoid including certain files in the repository. For example, it can be used to exclude the `data/` folder from the repository by adding the following line to the `.gitignore` file: `data/`
- The `README.md` file should include a description of the data files in the `data/` folder, including their source, format, and any necessary preprocessing steps.
- If there are multiple data files, the `data/` folder should be include subfolders to group related data files together.
